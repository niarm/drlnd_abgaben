### Solution for Project 1
This is my solution to the first project in the "Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree"

An implementation of a DQN(Deep Q-Network) solves a unity-Environment where it has to collect yellow bananas and avoid blue bananas.

#### Requirements
To run the main Notebook "main_solution.ipynb", please install:

1. pytorch 0.4
-- pip install torch

2. unityagents
-- pip install unityagents


Follow the instructions inside the Jupyter-Notebook "main_solution.ipynb"
